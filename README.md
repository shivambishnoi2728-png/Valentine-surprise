4. Right-click the GIF → "Copy image address"
5. Open `question.html` and replace the URL in line 17

## 🎁 How It Works

**Page Flow:**
1. **Landing Page**: Beautiful 3D pink gift box appears
   - When clicked, it opens with heart burst animation
   - Automatically goes to question page

2. **Question Page**: "Will you be my Valentine?"
   - Puppy eyes GIF shows
   - YES button is big and easy to click
   - NO button runs away when you try to hover/click it!
   - Gets smaller and faster each attempt
   - Shows funny hints after each attempt

3. **Success Page**: Celebration!
   - GIF changes to celebration
   - Confetti animation
   - Button to continue to photo gallery

4. **Photos Page**: Your memories together
   - Grid of photos with captions
   - "What I love about you" section
   - Final Valentine's message

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Photos not showing?**
- Make sure photo files are in the same folder as HTML files
- Check that filenames match exactly (photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, etc.)
- Make sure file extensions are lowercase (.jpg not .JPG)

**GIFs not loading?**
- Check your internet connection
- Try different GIF URLs from Giphy/Tenor
- Make sure you copied the full URL

**NO button not disappearing on mobile?**
- This is normal! On mobile it still moves when tapped
- The touch interaction works differently but still fun!

**Site looks weird on phone?**
- The site is responsive and should work on all devices
- Clear your browser cache and reload

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Test Everything First**: Open the site on your computer and phone before sharing
2. **Optimize Photos**: Large photos = slow loading. Use tinypng.com to compress
3. **Pick Good GIFs**: Make sure they load quickly and match the vibe
4. **Personal Touch**: Customize the messages to make it extra special
5. **Timing**: Send her the link at a special moment!

## 🎯 What to Do After She Says YES

The success page has a button that leads to your photo gallery. You can also:
- Add a countdown to Valentine's Day
- Include plans for your date
- Add more personal messages

## 📝 Notes

- All pink and black colors match Madam jiii's favorites
- The 3D gift box uses pure CSS (no images needed)
- The NO button becomes nearly impossible to click (but she can always click YES!)
- Photos have smooth hover animations
- Everything is mobile-friendly

## ❤️ Good Luck!

This is going to be so special! The combination of:
- Interactive 3D gift box 🎁
- Impossible-to-click NO button 😄
- Your photos together 📸
- Personal messages 💕

...will definitely make her smile!

**Remember**: The most important part is that it comes from your heart. She's going to love it!
